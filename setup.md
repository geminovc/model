This file describes the necessary processes involved in getting the model up and running on a new machine. Unfortunately,
I didn't do a good job with package management, so we use a combination of `conda` and `pip` here. 
## Mounting (only relevant if you're using a csail machine and need data/storage):
```bash
sudo mkdir /video-conf
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
sudo mount -t nfs ${mount_address} /video-conf
```

## Libopus/libvpx dependencies for aiortc:
```bash
sudo apt-get install libopus-dev libvpx-dev
```

## Getting Conda Environment:
Get latest version of conda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
```bash
cp /video-conf/scratch/vibhaa_tardy/nets_fom.txt nets_fom.txt
```

If python default in conda is different from whatâ€™s in the file, please change the line in the file accordingly. For that, figure out what the default python version is with the conda installation, then https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python/files?sort=basename&sort_order=desc&version=3.10.9 should help you find the python link for your version. Once edited, run
```bash
conda create --prefix /home/vibhaa/anaconda3/envs/vibhaa_nets_fom --file nets_fom.txt
```

## Getting aiortc
First, change home directory as need be; this assumes `aiortc` is in the home directory
Setup paths for aiortc import :
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=~/aiortc/gemino_model:~/aiortc/SwinIR
```

Compile aiortc inside conda environment: 
```bash
cd ~/aiortc
python setup.py install
```

## Pip for missing packages
There are still missing packages, so first get pip. Make sure the python command used here is coming from within conda by checking `which python`
```bash
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
python get_pip.py
```

Make sure the pip used below is within conda by checking `which pip`. If it does not point to the one in the environment, reference it using
`${env_dir}/bin/pip` instead.
```bash
pip install pyyaml matplotlib scikit-image scikit-learn torch torchvision torchprofile pandas flow_vis lpips av protobuf==3.20.0 piq bitstring
```

## Code changes
This is due to versioning issues with python 3.9 and latest associated packages.
* `augmentation.py`: `from skimage.util import pad` &rarr; `from numpy import pad`
* `logger.py`: `import circle` &rarr; `import disk as circle`
* `logger.py`: `circle(kp[1], kp0..`' &rarr; `circle((kp[1], kp[0])..`
* `run.py`: `yaml.load` &rarr; `yaml.full_load`
* `measure_times.py`: `yaml.load` &rarr; `yaml.full_load`
* `utils.py`: comment out `from swinir_wrapper import ...`
